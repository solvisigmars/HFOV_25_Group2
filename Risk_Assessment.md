1. Add Exercise to Workout Plan
  Risk Type: Usability Risk
  Users found it confusing when adding exercises into the workout because they were not quite sure if the exercise had been added into the workout successfully because there wasn't 
  good enough visual confirmation.
  Risk Reduction Measure: Add clearer visual confirmation for the user where it is clear that the exercise has been added into the workout. 

2. Browse Available Classes
  Risk Type: Functionality and Usability Risk.
  Users struggled with finding the class they wanted to attend because they could only search for classes by date. They found it taking too long of a time to do that. 
  Risk Reductions Measure: Implement better search and filter options to allow users to find the class they want to attend faster. For example could the user search for the class and 
  see when the next available classes are. 

3. Put Workout In Calendar
  Risk Type: UX Design Risk
  User find it confusing to add workouts to their calendar which is not good because seeing a workout plan helps keep them motivated and we don't want to make the unmotivated. 
  Risk Reduction Measure: We want to simplify the calendar UI so the user finds it easier to see when each workout is and we also want to add workout to calendar button when a user has 
  either created a custom workout or searched for a pre-built workout.
